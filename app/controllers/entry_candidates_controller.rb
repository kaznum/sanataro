    # In fact, order("max_id desc").limit(5) is better.
    # But SQL Server doesn't have limit and offset clauses.
    # Arel and the method `replace_limit_offset!' in SqlServerReplaceLimitOffset module
    # (in activerecord-jdbc-adapter gem) generates SQL to support them and it works well
    # for simple cases. But SQL Server cannot evaluate the generated query if order('...')
    # includes some aliased column names which are defined in select clause with 'AS ...'
    #
    # The following statement generates a complex query and using with `limit(5)` hits
    # the above problem, so it is conditional depending on whether MsSQL or not.
    # The current code can cost so much high because lots of records could be gotten
    # under MsSQL.
    # This may be better to be replaced with another way to implement.
